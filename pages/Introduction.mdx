    'environment' => 'sandbox', // or 'production'
    'shortcode' => 'your_shortcode',
    'key' => 'your_passkey'
]);

// Initiate STK Push
try {
    $response = $mpesa->stkPush(
        100, // Amount
        '251712345678', // Phone number
        'REF123', // Reference
        'Payment for goods' // Description
